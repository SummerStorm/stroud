# Stroud

Stroud is a lightweight Scala library that encrypts arbitrary data and encodes them into kanji characters 
for transmission over Twitter. Since Twitter has a 140-character limit, using ASCII characters would 
be very inefficient. By using kanji characters we can encode exactly 280 bytes per tweet.
